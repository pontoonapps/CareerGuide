# PONToon Community Map App API (v2)

This is a Node.js-based API, backed in MySQL, that contains map _pins_ submitted by users and provided by users' training centers.

This API is meant to support a mobile app.

## Installation

If you want to install the API at pontoonapps.com:

0. create a Node.js application in the cpanel
1. `npm install` to load all dependencies
2. make sure there's a MySQL database user available for this API implementation to use
   * the database must contain the table `users` (as per PONToonapps.com)
   * the database must contain the table `map_pins` (see `sql-init.sql` to create it)
   * the database user should be suitably constrained (only select from `users`, select/insert/update/delete in `map_pins`)
3. edit `config.json` (possibly create one from `config-template.json`)
   * create and give _API keys_ to app developer(s)


## API structure

The API runs at https://pontoonapps.com/community-api (referred to as `<root>` below). Data structures and authentication mechanisms are detailed in further sections.

The API has two versions: v1 (not indicated in the URL) used pin name to identify pins; v2 uses unique database-generated ID values instead.

The main routes are:

### Map Pin routes

* GET `<root>/v2/pins` – return array of all pins visible to this user
* POST `<root>/v2/pins` – add a user pin (accepts JSON)
  * if the JSON includes an ID, this is an update operation (existence of that ID among this user's pins is checked)
  * if the JSON does not include an ID, this is an add operation (creates a new pin)
  * returns 200 OK on success, the new/updated pin in the response
  * returns 409 Conflict if an update is requested but the ID doesn't exist
  * returns 400 Bad Request when data is malformed
* POST `<root>/v2/pins/delete` – remove a pin identified by ID and created by the calling user (accepts JSON)
  * the incoming JSON should only be `{ "id": value }`
  * a user can only delete their own pins
  * returns 204 No Content on success
  * returns 409 Conflict if the ID doesn't exist or doesn't belong to this user
  * returns 400 Bad Request when data is malformed


Original (v1) API:

* GET `<root>/pins` – return array of all pins visible to this user
* POST `<root>/pins` – add a user pin (accepts JSON)
  * if the user already has a pin with this name, the pin information is all updated
  * returns 204 No Content on success
  * returns 400 Bad Request when data is malformed
* POST `<root>/pins/delete` – remove a pin identified by name and created by the calling user (accepts JSON)
  * the incoming JSON should only be `{ "name": "..." }`
  * a user can only delete their own pins
  * if the user has multiple pins with the same name (v2), all will be deleted by this v1 call
  * returns 204 No Content on success (even if pin with the name didn't exist)
  * returns 400 Bad Request when data is malformed

#### Data structures

A pin is represented in the API with the following data structure:
```
{
  id:             (API v2)   opaque (generated by server, unique for the user),
  name:                      String (max 255 chars in v2,
                                     in v1 max 40 chars and unique for the user)
  latitude:                  Number,
  longitude:                 Number,
  category:       (optional) Number,
  description:    (optional) String (max 255 chars),
  phone:          (optional) String (max 25 chars),
  website:        (optional) String (max 255 chars),
  email:          (optional) String (max 255 chars),
  address_line_1: (optional) String (max 255 chars),
  address_line_2: (optional) String (max 255 chars),
  postcode:       (optional) String (max 12 chars),
  notes:          (optional) String (max 255 chars),
}
```

A pin returned by the API can also have a field `userPin` (Boolean) – `true` if this pin was submitted by the user, and `false` if it comes from a training centre. Training centre pins also have `training_centre_email` so the app can show which training centre provided this pin.


### Training Centre routes:

(v1 and v2 APIs are the same, the `/v2` part of the URL is optional)

These routes return `403 Forbidden` if the current user is not a training centre (role "recruiter").

* GET `<root>[/v2]/training-centre/users` – return array of emails of the users assigned to the authenticated training centre
* POST `<root>[/v2]/training-centre/users` – add (assign) and remove (unassign) users to this training centre. Input data:
  ```
  {
    add:     (optional)  [ email strings ],
    remove:  (optional)  [ email strings ],
  }
  ```
  - removal is processed first, then addition – if both arrays contain the same email address, the user will be added;
  - users that do not exist in the database will be ignored (the client should report the email addresses that weren't added);
  - removing users that were not assigned to the training centre is also ignored;
  - returns the result list of users assigned to the training centre (like the GET method above).

### User routes:

(v1 and v2 APIs are the same, the `/v2` part of the URL is optional)

These routes return `403 Forbidden` if the current user is not a normal user (i.e. if they are a training centre).

* GET `<root>[/v2]/user/training-centres` – return array of training centres of the given user (same data structure as in `training_centres` at `<root>/login` below)
* POST `<root>[/v2]/user/training-centres/remove` – remove the calling user from the given training centre (accepts JSON)
  * the incoming JSON should only be `{ "email": "..." }`
  * returns 204 No Content on success (even if the user wasn't in the given training centre)
  * returns 400 Bad Request when data is malformed

### Status and check routes:

* GET `<root>/` – returns a successful response if the API is running and supports v1 (no authentication needed)
* GET `<root>/v2/` – returns a successful response if the API supports v2 (no authentication needed)
* GET `<root>[/v2]/ping` – returns a successful response if the API key is accepted (only API key needed)
* GET `<root>[/v2]/login` – (optional) returns information about the user, in the following format:
  ```
  {
    role:                "user" or "recruiter",
    training_centres: [
      {
        email:           String,
        name: {
          first:         String,
          last:          String,
        }
      },
      …
    ]
  }
  ```
  - notes
    - in pontoonapps, training centres have "recruiter" role;
    - `training_centres` is there only if the role is "user"; if the user is not assigned to any training centre, it will be an empty array.

### Authentication

The API must only be accessed over HTTPS.

The API uses an **API key provided as a URL query parameter** `apiKey`; this key should be kept privately by the developers of the mobile app(s). If a key is found to be misused, it can be revoked. With the wrong key, the API returns 403 Forbidden.

If your key is ABCDEFGH, you can check the API at https://pontoonapps.com/community-api/ping?apiKey=ABCDEFGH

Users in the app use their pontoonapps.com account details: the API accepts pontoonapps.com "job seekers" (internally under the role _user_) and "recruiters".

The app uses these account details (email and password) with **HTTP Basic Authentication** in all API requests (except `ping`). Without valid credentials, the API returns 401 Unauthorized.

Any registered user can request their map pins at `<root>[/v2]/pins`; if they have never submitted any, this will return an empty array.

_NB: The login API call is only for checking role and training centres and is not required; there are no sessions and every API request contains the credentials._




## Assumptions

* pontoonapps.com always uses HTTPS, which should be sufficient for network security (in particular, it should be OK to use Basic Auth)
* pontoonapps.com recruiters act as training centres for the community map API.

## Future considerations

* recognized API keys probably could be in the database rather than in the config file
* check that in cpanel we can't have more fine-grained access control than db-wide privileges
